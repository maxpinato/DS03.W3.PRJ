This repository contain `run_analysis.R` that produce two tiny dataset explained on codebook.md and a file with the result of the `har.ds.grp' dataset.

It uses dplyr to simplify some operation (with the use of pipeline operator) and data.table to read large amount of file (x-files are very large).
